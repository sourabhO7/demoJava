**Problem statement of GloLogistics:**

GloLogistics, a prominent leader in the logistics industry and supply chain, has established an extensive network of suppliers. To efficiently manage this vast network, they initially relied on file handling systems. However, they encountered challenges with data redundancy, particularly in handling duplicate entries. Recognizing the need for a more robust solution, GloLogistics made a strategic decision to migrate their operations to a database system utilizing JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

Here, Alex has showcase the various types of statement in terms of the implementation and to know more about the benefit of these refer the content documentation available in the ppt slide no 3.
